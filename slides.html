# Target *everybody*

A lot of the time there's no need to restrict your target audience to just NodeJS developers. You may be writing browser-friendly code without even realising it. Think about the ways that your module might be used in browsers.

```bash
browserify index.js > randomCheeseGenerator.js
uglify randomCheeseGenerator.js > randomCheeseGenerator.min.js
```

--

**HOWEVER:** Make sure you dependencies are browser-safe!

# The art of a good **README**

They're called READMEs for a reason: someone looking at your project for the first time should be given all the information they need to get started with it. More broadly, what's the purpose of the README? It tells prospective users the following:

1. That it's *legit*
2. How to use it
3. Whether it's going to be maintained and kept up-to-date
4. Whether it's reliable enough to use in production

# The Importance of Good Dependency Management

You know how sometimes you install a module and it *just won't work* even though the Travis build is fine and the developer's documentation is really good and there aren't any issues and you've SLAMMED YOUR FIST ON THE TABLE LIKE FIVE HUNDRED TIMES?!

--

That's because the developer didn't use `npm shrinkwrap`.

---

# Good Dependency Management

`npm shrinkwrap` is a command which will create a file recording the module's dependencies at the exact point they are at in the current directory. So while `package.json` may have a requirement for `"request": "^2.42.0"`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json` will contain *specifically* version 2.42.0 if that's what you have installed.

1. You `shrinkwrap` your module with version `2.42.0`
2. `request` gets upgraded to `2.42.1`, `2.42.2`, etc. which are all theoretically compatible with 2.42.0
3. Without `shrinkwrap`, `npm install`ing your module would cause the latest in `2.42.x` to be installed, but since you have `shrinkwrap`'d, `2.42.0` specifically will be installed.

---

# Good Dependency Management

**Note:** By default, `npm shrinkwrap` will not include `devDependencies`. To include these you've gotta run `npm shrinkwrap --dev`. This means people cloning from the source will get the `shrinkwrap`ped development dependencies *and* the regular, non-dev ones.

---

# Good Dependency Management

`npm prune` is a command which will remove any modules you have installed but not currently in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` sections of `package.json`.

This is a handy thing to use *before* you run `npm shrinkwrap`. If you run `npm shrinkwrap` and get an `extraneous` error, then it's because you have non-saved dependencies. Either save them, or `npm prune` them out of your project.

---

# Good Dependency Management

On the other hand, if your project has a bunch of dependencies that you've `npm install`ed but forgot to `--save`, you might want to fix that. You can use the package `require-analyzer` to analyse your codebase to find un-save directories. Get it on npm, of course:

```bash
npm install -g require-analyzer
# Go to your project folder, run:
require-analyzer
# It will update package.json for you
```

# Versioning

# Versioning

First off, in case you aren't familiar with it, Semantic Versioning, aka SemVer, is the way we version JavaScript modules. If you aren't doing it, you're ruining the ecosystem for everyone else. No excuses!

How does Semantic Versioning work? Here's a primer on the basics: `major.minor.patch`, e.g. `1.2.3`

* `major` - This number is incremented when changes to the module include *incompatibilities* with previous versions, e.g. `generateLNUGTalk()` gets changed to `writeBrilliantLNUGTalk()`.
* `minor` - This number is incremented when new functionality is added which is backwards-compatible, such as a new function called `saveLNUGTalkToPDF()`.
* `patch` - This number is incremented when you make backwards-compatible bugfixes or refactoring.

---

# Versioning

You might just go into `package.json` and

1. Change the `version` string... then, 
2. Create a `git commit` specifically for this change
3. Create a `git tag` so that GitHub users can find snapshots of the module at specific points in time.

This sounds like three different actions, right? WRONG!

--

`npm version` to the rescue!

---

# Versioning

`npm version [major|minor|patch]` is a command which not only increments the appropriate number in `package.json`, but creates a `git commit` and `git tag`. Example:

```bash
# Let's say our module is currently at version 3.1.5
npm version minor -m "v3.2.0 Added insertRelevantGIFsIntoSlides function"
```

This will automatically increment the `1` to `2` and reset the `5` to `0`, then create a `git commit` with the message `"v3.2.0 Added insertRelevantGIFsIntoSlides function"`, and then create `git tag` called `v3.2.0` pointing at this new commit.

--

This is a hugely satisfying command.

# A pre-publish checklist
## What to do after you've finished your change, and before you publish the module
]

---

# A pre-publish checklist

1. Figure out what the next version is, and remember that. If you're currently on 0.23.3 and it's a bugfix/patch, it'll be 0.23.4 next.
2. Update the changelog either in `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`. Add an entry for the day you're publishing, saying what the change was.
3. Make sure your dependencies are locked down. Run `npm prune` then `npm shrinkwrap --dev`.
4. If you're targeting the front-end, compile your code using `browserify`
5. Commit these changes, you don't need to mention the version code yet...
6. Run `npm version` with `major`, `minor`, or `patch` and a message, using `-m` - this will be your commit message.
7. Do a quick `git push`
8. You're done! `npm publish` will push changes to npm. Well done!

# Your community of contributors is made up of **real** people with **real** feelings, who put **real** time into making your project a little bit better!
]

# How can your community feel included?

## Publicly recognise contributions

* Try a `contributors.md` file, or a little list in `readme.md`, with links to the GitHub profiles of people who've made successful pull requests.
* Thank them in the `changelog`, too?

This will not only will you encourage more contributors, but you'll get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, and so will your new open-source-co-workers.

---

# How can your community feel listened-to?

## Respond as quickly as possible

For people to respect the work you've done and know that you care a little about it, I think it's important to respond to issues and pull requests quickly.

This doesn't mean reading in-depth the moment they're received and replying with a comprehensive comment about why their pull request isn't adequate and how they can improve it: that can wait. A simple "Hey, thanks for your PR - I've seen it and I'll give it a proper read as soon as I can! Thanks!" will do.

---

# How to improve community contributions

## Respond honestly

If you receive an issue with a feature request and think immediately, "I don't want this in my module", then say so sooner rather than later: be honest with the person and close the issue.

---

# How to prevent your project from dying

## Take on extra help, and/or quit!

If you're losing interest in the project and the issues are piling up, get in touch with some of the people who've contributed, or advertise on places like Hacker News, Reddit or the LNUG Gitter channel that you're looking for maintainers to help with or take over your project.

It's better that it's kept up-to-date with the help of others than floundering under your sole ownership.
